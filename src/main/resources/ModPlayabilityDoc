        To Cycle through Modes on the Rift Mechanism right click without looking at any block.
        Modes Include:
            - Clear: Currently this doesn't offer a function, but it is expected to clear current Rift Links tied to the Player and the rift mechanism.
            - Gui: Currently this doesn't offer a function, but it is expected to open the GUI of some tile entities which offer special functionality.
            - Insert: This sets the Side of the RiftTileEntity the ability to bring Items in from another TileEntity.
            - Eject: This sets the Side of a TileEntity the ability to eject items from the inventory(When used on a
                non-riftTileEntity, it will save the Inventory to the Side and save it to the Rift inventory.
        Examples:

        To Connect a Chest to a Rift Chest You will Change Rift Mechanism to Insert > Punch the Rift Chest Side to create Home Link
        > Change Rift Mechanism to Eject > Punch Chest Side to create Guest Link and it Establishes a Connection.

    Rift Chest - Special Chest that is used to transfer Items through the Rift Link between space and time. Using a
        Rift mechanism, a special tool to establish the links, you can link the Rift Chest to various inventories.
        By default and currently the only way to get items out of the rift chest is to place an adjacent inventory
        next to the rift chest to pull items out.
